 * This program plays the basic Shave and A Haircut tune
 * 170101 Switched to TimeFreeTone used extern melody and noteDurations
 *        Need to add sizeof array to for statement rather than count array members
 *  Arduino example for Tone() <== search on
 * 170101_tr closed first version and sent to svn via Arduino/libsraies
 * 161113_tr Copied in mass as  shown below and then split into cpp and h files
 * Arduino example for Tone() <== search on
